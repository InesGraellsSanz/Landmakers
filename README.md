# SwiftUI Essentials â€“ Landmarks App 

This project is based on the **SwiftUI Essentials: Creating and Combining Views** tutorial by Apple.  
It guided me through building **Landmarks**, an iOS app for discovering and sharing the places you love.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview
For the completion of this tutorial it was done:
- Build a SwiftUI view that shows a landmarkâ€™s details.
- Learn how to **combine views** using stacks (`VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack`).
- Add a **MapKit component** to display locations.
- Refine the view design while getting real-time feedback in Xcode.

The app demonstrates the foundations of **SwiftUI development**: declarative syntax, previewing changes live, and structuring reusable UI components.
